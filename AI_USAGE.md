# Documentation on Use of AI Tools

The development of this project was aided by GitHub Copilot and DeepSeek. Copilot was especially helpful for working with the geopandas library, which was used for creating the coloured cluster world maps. In particular, it suggested the use of the geojson polygons from the geodata data package, helped in fixing placeholder codes, and aided the creation of the manual legend. DeepSeek was also used primarily for debugging, understanding error messages, and clarifying logic errors. It was also helpful in understanding unfamiliar commands, like choropleth mapping for geopandas, and suggesting "DEBUG" prints that helped verify that the data pipeline's transformations were being carried out as originally intended. 

DeepSeek was also particularly useful for helping understand code suggested by GitHub Copilot's Inline Suggestions, as they were often inaccurate. DeepSeek also helped me understand the mathematical logic behind PCA and hierarchical clustering and the explanations for these operations provided online on the sci-kit learn website.
